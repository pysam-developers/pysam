Release 0.8.4
=============

This release contains numerous bugfixes and a first implementation of
a pythonic interface to VCF/BCF files. Note that this code is still
incomplete and preliminary, but does offer a nearly complete immutable
Pythonic interface to VCF/BCF metadata and data with reading and
writing capability.

Potential isses when upgrading from v0.8.3:

* binary tags are now returned as python arrays

* renamed several methods for pep8 compatibility, old names still retained for	
  backwards compatibility, but should be considered deprecated.
   * gettid() is now get_tid()
   * getrname() is now get_reference_name()
   * parseRegion() is now parse_region()

* some methods have changed for pep8 compatibility without the old
  names being present:
   * fromQualityString() is now qualitystring_to_array()
   * toQualityString() is now qualities_to_qualitystring()
   
* faidx now returns strings and not binary strings in py3.

* The cython components have been broken up into smaller files with
  more specific content. This will affect users using the cython
  interfaces.

Release 0.8.3
=============

* samtools command now accept the "catch_stdout" option.

* get_aligned_pairs now works for soft-clipped reads.

* query_position is now None when a PileupRead is not aligned
  to a particular position.

* AlignedSegments are now comparable and hashable.

Release 0.8.2.1
===============

* Installation bugfix release.

Release 0.8.2
=============

* Pysam now wraps htslib 1.2.1 and samtools version 1.2.

* Added CRAM file support to pysam.

* New alignment info interface.
   * opt() and setTag are deprecated, use get_tag() and set_tag()
     instead.
   * added has_tag()
   * tags is deprecated, use get_tags() and set_tags() instead.

* FastqFile is now FastxFile to reflect that the latter permits
  iteration over both fastq- and fasta-formatted files.

* A Cython wrapper for htslib VCF/BCF reader/writer. The wrapper
  provides a nearly complete Pythonic interface to VCF/BCF metadata
  with reading and writing capability. However, the interface is still
  incomplete and preliminary and lacks capability to mutate the
  resulting data.
  
Release 0.8.1
=============

* Pysam now wraps htslib and samtools versions 1.1.

* Bugfixes, most notable:
  * issue #43: uncompressed BAM output
  * issue #42: skip tests requiring network if none available
  * issue #19: multiple iterators can now be made to work on the same tabix file
  * issue #24: All strings returned from/passed to the pysam API are now unicode in python 3
  * issue #5:  type guessing for lists of integers fixed    
    
* API changes for consistency. The old API is still present,
  but deprecated.
  In particular:

  * Tabixfile -> TabixFile
  * Fastafile -> FastaFile
  * Fastqfile -> FastqFile
  * Samfile -> AlignmentFile
  * AlignedRead -> AlignedSegment
     * qname -> query_name
     * tid -> reference_id
     * pos -> reference_start
     * mapq -> mapping_quality
     * rnext -> next_reference_id
     * pnext -> next_reference_start
     * cigar -> cigartuples
     * cigarstring -> cigarstring
     * tlen -> template_length
     * seq -> query_sequence
     * qual -> query_qualities, now returns array
     * qqual -> query_alignment_qualities, now returns array
     * tags -> tags
     * alen -> reference_length, reference is always "alignment", so removed
     * aend -> reference_end
     * rlen -> query_length
     * query -> query_alignment_sequence
     * qstart -> query_alignment_start
     * qend -> query_alignment_end
     * qlen -> query_alignment_length
     * mrnm -> next_reference_id   
     * mpos -> next_reference_start
     * rname -> reference_id
     * isize -> template_length
     * blocks -> get_blocks()
     * aligned_pairs -> get_aligned_pairs()
     * inferred_length -> infer_query_length()
     * positions -> get_reference_positions()
     * overlap() -> get_overlap()

  * All strings are now passed to or received from the pysam API
    as strings, no more bytes.

Other changes:
   * AlignmentFile.fetch(reopen) option is now multiple_iterators. The
     default changed to not reopen a file unless requested by the user.
   * FastaFile.getReferenceLength is now FastaFile.get_reference_length

Backwards incompatible changes

* Empty cigarstring now returns None (intstead of '')
* Empty cigar now returns None (instead of [])
* When using the extension classes in cython modules, AlignedRead
  needs to be substituted with AlignedSegment. 
* fancy_str() has been removed
* qual, qqual now return arrays




Release 0.8.0
=============

* Disabled features
   * IteratorColumn.setMask() disabled as htslib does not implement
     this functionality?

* Not implemented yet:
   * reading SAM files without header

Tabix files between version 0.7.8 and 0.8.0 are
not compatible and need to be re-indexed.

While version 0.7.8 and 0.8.0 should be mostly
compatible, there are some notable exceptions:

* tabix iterators will fail if there are comments
  in the middle or the end of a file.

* tabix raises always ValueError for invalid intervals.
  Previously, different types of errors were raised
  (KeyError, IndexError, ValueError) depending on
  the type of invalid intervals (missing chromosome,
  out-of-range, malformatted interval).
