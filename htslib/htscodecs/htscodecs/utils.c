 * We have some large memory blocks for rANS which we cannot store on the
 * stack due to various system limitations.  Allocaitng them can be
 * expensive as some OSes use mmap and will pass the pages back to the OS
 * on each free.  This unfortunately then means zeroing the pages out again
 * on each new malloc, plus additional switching into the kernel.
 *
 * Instead where available, we use pthread_once to allocate a small arena
 * of memory buffers and we continually reuse these same buffers.  We don't
 * need to memset it (calloc equivalent) either as we're sure that any
 * leakage of data is simply an earlier set of precomputed frequency
 * lookups, and not something more sinister such as an encryption key.
 *
 * If we don't have pthreads, then we have to fall back to the slow
 * traditional calloc instead.
