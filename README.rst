Pysam is a python module for reading and manipulating files in the
SAM/BAM format. The SAM/BAM format is a way to store efficiently large
numbers of alignments (`Li 2009`_), such as those routinely created by
next-generation sequencing methods.

Pysam is a lightweight wrapper of the samtools_ C-API. Pysam also
includes an interface for tabix_.

If you are using the conda packaging manager (e.g. miniconda or anaconda),
you can install pysam from the `bioconda channel <https://bioconda.github.io/>`_::

   conda config --add channels r
   conda config --add channels bioconda
   conda install pysam

Installation through bioconda is the recommended way to install pysam
as it resolves non-python dependencies and uses pre-configured
compilation options. Especially for OS X this will potentially save a
lot of trouble.

Pysam is available through `pypi
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pysam>`_. To install, type::

   pip install pysam

Pysam documentation is available 
`here <http://pysam.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_
