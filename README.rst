Pysam is a python module for reading and manipulating files in the
SAM/BAM format. The SAM/BAM format is a way to store efficiently large
numbers of alignments (`Li 2009`_), such as those routinely created by
next-generation sequencing methods.

Pysam is a lightweight wrapper of the samtools_ C-API. Pysam also
includes an interface for tabix_.

The latest version is available through `pypi
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pysam>`_. To install, simply type::
  
   pip install pysam
